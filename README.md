This portfolio is about all the work I did for ITAI 1378 and what I learn along the way.
This repository is organized by modules and projects I had in this class.
At the beginning of the semester I was aware of computer vision but did not know the full extent of what it entail. At the end I became more familiar with it and also some of the tools and libaries use. Also that there were pre-trained models and reinforcement learning. This course also thought me about jupyter notebook and github.
